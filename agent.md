# Agent Guidelines

This repository uses a small ASP.NET Core application. When making changes, follow these rules:

- Use C# coding conventions.
- Run `dotnet build` if the SDK is available to ensure the project compiles.
- Keep commits focused and descriptive.
- Update documentation when behavior changes.
