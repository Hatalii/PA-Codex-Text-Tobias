This sample app is an ASP.NET Core game that renders a simple car avoidance game on a canvas.

## Features

- Player and enemy cars are drawn using images rather than rectangles.
- Enemies spawn periodically in random lanes. Trucks use their own sprite.
- Colliding with an enemy pauses the game and displays a reset prompt.
- Press the **Reset** button to clear enemies and place the player back in the center lane.

Run the application with your preferred ASP.NET hosting environment.
